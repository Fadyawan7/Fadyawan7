//.............. Decreasing apk size ////////////////////////


🚀 How We Cut Flutter App Size by 40%
Our Flutter app used to be 58 MB.
 Now it’s 34 MB — with zero features removed.
 Here’s what made the biggest difference 
1️⃣ Removed Debug Symbols
 flutter build apk --split-debug-info=build/debug-info
 → -8 MB instantly.
2️⃣ Optimized Assets
 Compressed images + deleted unused files.
 Saved ~12 MB.
3️⃣ Tree-Shaking & Code Cleanup
 flutter build apk --release + DevTools → no dead code.
4️⃣ Import Only What You Need
 Don’t pull the whole Firebase suite for one function.
5️⃣ Split by ABI
 flutter build apk --split-per-abi
 Smaller, device-specific APKs = faster installs.
Result: 58 MB → 34 MB.
